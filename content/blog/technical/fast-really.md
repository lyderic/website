I was looking at <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/">this very interesting set of benchmarks of web frameworks</a>. I started to really get deep into the results, taking ideas on new tools and technologies I could learn to make my websites faster.

And then I realised, why bother being fast? The slowest framework will always be faster than any website that displays some kind of advertising! (that is any website). What slows the web down is not underperforming networks, hardware or software, it is advertising. The reason people hate advertising on webpages is the ever growing intrusion that it represents but also, the fact that it ruins page loading time.

Don't believe me? Run an adblocker and you will see the difference!
