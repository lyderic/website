In Java, I very often have to do the following, to mark the plural when needed:
<pre>System.out.printf("Delivered: %d item%s", n, n &gt; 1 ? "s", "");
</pre>
In Lua, there is no ternary operator, so this kind of elegant syntax might be compromised in this situation. Fortunately, there is an as nice workaround:
<pre>print(string.format("Delivered: %d item%s", n &gt; 1 and "s" or ""))</pre>
