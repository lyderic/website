I have started to learn go, Google's system language. I really like it. I appreciate these features in particular:
<ol>
 	<li>It is truly cross-platform, in par with java</li>
 	<li>It has a huge standard library, again like java's but without the GUI stuff</li>
 	<li>It compiles to standalone executables that include the runtime! Imagine a JAR file that would carry a little JVM with it. No need to "install go" on a deployment machine!</li>
</ol>
In terms of design, it takes a little bit of time to get used to. But on the whole it is fairly easy and straightforward. I have a good knowledge of C, java, lua and bash and I had no problem to adapt to go.

Highly recommended!
